0.2.0 to 0.3.0

- Rules are measured by how much they slow down a whole scan if they're added to 100+ rules in baseline.yar. This might happen due to bad "atom quality" as explained in yara/libyara/atoms.c
- Increase accuracy by:
-- Reading samples into RAM (to avoid OS calls to get them from the file system cache)
-- Recommending using real time priority and processing bindung in Linux (needs root permissions)
- Fast mode: Skip a rule on the first scan which is fast enough
- Progress bar
- Pass Thor/Loki environment variables to yara-python
